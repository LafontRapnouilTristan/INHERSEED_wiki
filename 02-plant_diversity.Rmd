## Species list

XX plant species were used in INHERSEED.
This represent a challenge both to grow and monitor such diversity as well as to sample and properly phenotype plants and seeds varying tremendously in size, shapes and looks.
Acknowledging this challenge we tried to adopt protocols and data viewing/analysis allowing to compare *Arabidopsis*, carrots or beans.
That being said, we recognize that critics can still be made and our results should be regarded with the diversity-challenge in mind!

The full species list:

We focused on non-woody annual species and tried to have a good spread across the Angiosperm phylogeny:

## General informations

In order to interpret our results, we wanted to get as many information on our species from botany to chemistry.

### TRY
First we identified a set of traits that may be found on the [TRY database](https://www.try-db.org/) [@kattge2019].
TRY requires manual requests and we used R to prepare our requests.

#### Request

First check if our species have entries in TRY.
```{r}
# INSTALL AND LOAD
# install.packages("rtry")
library(rtry)
library()
#get list of TRY species
# download.file('https://try-db.org/dnld/TryAccSpecies.txt', destfile = "data/TRY/TryAccSpecies.tsv", method = "wget", extra = "-r -p --random-wait", quiet = T)
#get our species list
species_list <- readr::read_tsv("data/species_list_INHERSEED.tsv")
#check overlap and merge
try_sp <- species_list %>%
  rename(scientific_cleaned = species_for_tree)%>%
  select(scientific_cleaned) %>%
  mutate(scientific_cleaned=ifelse(scientific_cleaned=="Legousia veneris","Legousia speculum-veneris",scientific_cleaned))%>% #rename that species properly
  na.omit() %>%
  unique() %>%
  left_join(readr::read_tsv("data/TRY/TryAccSpecies.txt"),
            by = c("scientific_cleaned" = "AccSpeciesName")
  )

#species not in try
try_sp%>%
  mutate(is_in_try=ifelse(is.na(AccSpeciesID),"Not in TRY","In Try"))%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=is_in_try,fill=is_in_try))+
  geom_histogram(stat = "count")+
  theme_minimal()+
  ylab("Number of species")+
  xlab("")+
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        text = element_text(face="bold"))+
  ggtitle(paste0(sum(!is.na(try_sp$AccSpeciesID))," species out of ", nrow(try_sp)," are in TRY"))
```

Now we can build a request for TRY with our traits of interest.
We handpicked from TRY traits list XX traits that were relevant to us.  
```{r}
try_request <- try_sp%>%
  summarise(species_list=paste0(AccSpeciesID,collapse = ", "))
try_request%>%
  readr::write_tsv("data/TRY/requests/TryReqSpecies.tsv")

traits_try <- readxl::read_xlsx("data/TRY/traits_of_interest/Traits repro TRY database.xlsx")
try_request_traits <- traits_try%>%
  filter(tokeep=="y")%>%
  select(TraitID)%>%
  summarise(traits_list=paste0(TraitID,collapse = ", "))
try_request_traits%>%
  readr::write_tsv("data/TRY/requests/TryReqTraits.tsv")
# 41259 - ID of the first request
```

Then we requested TRY data access using our species and traits lists.

####Release


```{r}
try_release <- readr::read_tsv("data/TRY/release/41259_1905202519280_TRY_relaease/41259.txt")
try_release %<>%
  select(AccSpeciesName, TraitName, StdValue) %>%
  rename(
    species = AccSpeciesName,
    trait = TraitName,
    value = StdValue
  ) %>%
  group_by(species, trait) %>%
  summarise(value = mean(as.numeric(value), na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  tidyr::pivot_wider(values_from = "value", names_from = "trait")%>%
  mutate(across(everything(),~ifelse(.x=="NaN",NA,.x)))



try_release%>%
  reshape2::melt(id.vars=c("species"))%>%
  group_by(variable)%>%
  mutate(is_na_var=ifelse(is.na(value),0,1))%>%
  summarise(pct_species_avail=(sum(is_na_var)/82)*100)%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=pct_species_avail,y=variable))+
  geom_point()+
  theme_minimal()



try_release%>%
  reshape2::melt(id.vars=c("species"))%>%
  group_by(variable)%>%
  mutate(is_na_var=ifelse(is.na(value),0,1))%>%
  summarise(pct_species_avail=(sum(is_na_var)/82)*100)%>%
  filter(pct_species_avail>0)%>%
  readr::write_tsv("data/TRY/release/traits_with_some_values.tsv")
```
