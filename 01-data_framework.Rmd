# Data framework

INHERSEED aims to respect the FAIR principles for open science. To do so we share in the present document protocols, raw data, processing scripts/procedures and, processed data as used in resulting articles \@ref(fig:dframework).

```{r dframework, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.cap="Shared info regarding acquisition, raw data, processing and published data in the INHERSEED project"}
knitr::include_graphics('./documents/d_framework.png')
```

To ensure reproducibility data standard processing (bioinformatic pipeline and diagnostics) were embbeded in snakemake pipeline. R session info were also stored as text files available here.
